          <p>Create a sushi monstrosity. Select the items you wish to produce and hit "generate". A sorter system will be 
            created along with individual blueprints for every item and its component items. Stamp down the ones you want to make on site
            and bring in the others via the "Input row" blueprint, connected to the left of the sorter.
